# OpenAPI Codegen

## Getting started

```bash
$ npx @openapi-codegen/cli init
```

Follow the steps, this will generate you a configuration file (openapi-codegen.config.ts) and update your `package.json`

```bash
$ yarn gen # or the defined alias
```

You should have a bunch of types / components ready to be used.
